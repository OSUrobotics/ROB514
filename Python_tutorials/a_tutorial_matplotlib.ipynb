    "\n",
    "A note on using matplotlib in Jupyter notebooks. The most stable, easily transportable version of plotting is *inline* plotting. In this mode, matplotlib executes all of the plot-related commands in the cell, makes an image, and puts the image in the output. matplotlib itself is capable of making stand-alone windows that have handy interactive tools that let you zoom in, click on the plots to see data, and all sorts of other useful things (interactive plotting). It **is** possible to do this within a Jupyter notebook, but a generic Jupyter Notebook won't support it (yet). To keep this code portable, we're just going to do inline plotting.\n"
