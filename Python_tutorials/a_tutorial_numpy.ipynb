    "# What is numpy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy (and scipy) are python libraries for doing numerical and scientific calculations. Pretty much any mathematical or signal processing operation you would find in a text book is implemented in one of those libraries. Much of the functionality of MatLab is here, along with plotting (see matplotlib and the tutorial on matplotlib).\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of numpy is the numpy array data structure. These are n-dimensional arrays, all of the same data type with every element in a dimension the same size (unlike python lists, which can mix and match data types and array dimension sizes),\n",
    "\n",
    "Because numpy arrays are all of the same type/size, it's possible to do the same operation to all of the elements of an array really, really fast. This is the heart of using numpy; instead of explicitly writing **for** loops, numpy \"overrides\" operations (like *, +, <, > ==) so that they happen to the entire array (all n dimensions of it) all at once, in one line of code. There's still **for** loops in there, it's just Python is doing it for you. If you find yourself writing a **for** loop with a numpy array, btw, chances are you shouldn't be. Not that it's wrong, it's just really, really slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are all of the operations (min, max, sum, filter, etc) in numpy/scipy that use numpy arrays as input. These are very powerful, but it can be challenging to set up data and function parameters correctly to get them to work the way you want. We'll cover basics here, and more in-depth later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**import numpy as np**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the way I like to import numpy. All numpy operations will start with np. I just find it easier (when reading the code) to have this visual cue that this function/operation came from numpy. It also prevents name conflicts - for example, if you accidentally name a variable \"min\" you won't \"overwrite\" numpy's min. Also, if you cut and paste your code somewhere else, it's easier to get it working without name conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You need to install the numpy library in order to use it. If you followed the instructions in the VS Code install then numpy should already be installed; but if you pick the wrong base python you may get a \"not installed\" error. The following cell will fix this."

    "\n",
    "For the first case there's almost always a numpy function that will do the data reading and return a numpy array. For the second, the best approach is to read the data into a python list and then create the numpy array from the list. This avoids the problem of needing to know the data sizes in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating an array from a list (Example 2)\n",
    "\n",

    "Size and Shape are often confused for each other, and doubly so when the numpy array is one dimensional (in which case there is an additional confusion between row-column and column row). This confusion doesn't usually result in an Python error, but is usually some version of \"I thought that array would be bigger (or smaller)\", or \"I thought I made a matrix nxm\", and occasionally as a mis-matched size array or invalid index error.\n",
    "\n",
    "One quick check (for both this error and the next one) is to print out (or check in the variable window) BOTH print(f\"Size {a.size} and shape {a.shape} of array a\"). That way, you don't have to remember which is which.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shape is the dimensions of the array, Size is the number of elements. Shape is a tuple, Size is an integer\n",
    "\n",
