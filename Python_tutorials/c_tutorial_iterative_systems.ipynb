    "# Iterative systems (using functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "A large number of engineering/economics/ecosystem problems can be defined by how things change over time (basically partial differential equations). One of the very first examples of this is the \"predator-prey\" equations, also known as the Lotka-Volterra equations (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations). There is no shortage of problems that can be written like this, from how leopard spots form (reaction-diffusion equations) to modeling heat diffusion to chemical reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to focus on implementing a very simple iterative example - calculating how an object moves as it is thrown up in the air - and focus on one of the more challenging aspects of this type of problem - the role of time. There are two common issues with iterative examples, one theoretical, another a common programming mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time\n",
    "Equations are continuous. We approximate them computationally by taking time steps. The smaller the time step, the more accurate - but slow - the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Theoretical: If the time step is too big, and/or the derivatives are changing a lot, then the approximation is off.   Unfortunately, setting the time step to be really small means the entire thing runs really slow.\n",
    "- When calculating the values for the next time step, ALL of the input values should be from the previous time step. It is rather easy to accidentally use a next-time-step value in the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code: This will also be an example of functions calling functions - structuring code so it doesn't all happen in one big chunk. This helps prevent problem 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation we're going to do has what's called a closed-form solution - you can just write down where the object is\n",
    "after a given amount of time. We're going to use that equation to \"check\" our answer. Of course, the reason this example is used all the time when teaching is because it *has* a closed form solution - most real-world examples  don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "I like this version of describing the formula: https://www.fisicalab.com/en/section/parabolic-motion but there is no shortage of descriptions out there (Google parabolic path thrown object, or something similar)"
