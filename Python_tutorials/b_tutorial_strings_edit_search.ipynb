    "# Tutorial: Editing strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you have to take a string and edit it. Strings are IMMUTABLE - that means, you can't edit them in place. So all editing looks like copying over the pieces you want to keep and making a new string.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a TON of existing routines for editing and searching and taking apart strings:\n",
    " - Upper/lower case, is it a letter, number or a white space, take out special characters\n",
    " - Find a character or a substring in a string, does the string contain these characters?\n",
    " - Split up a string into a list of strings\n",
    " \n",
    "See https://docs.python.org/2.5/lib/string-methods.html\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial won't cover all of them, just some of the most useful. In general, there will not be a single command to \"Remove the apostrophe's and the dashes from the names, make sure they're all lower case, and merge first and middle names\". Instead, you have to figure out which 2-3 of the commands get you close (strip, split, find, tolower) and then apply them one after the other (eg, convert everything to lower case, then strip out the dashes, then remove the spaces) with some logic (if 2 strings after split versus 3)."
