# --------------------------- Matrix routines -------------------------
#
# This will be our first example of making a .py file that is imported into the jupyter notebook/other .py file
# This is so that the basic matrix functions - making matrices, checking them, plotting - can be in one place,
# the re-used in multiple places using "import". 
#
# The code is organized as
#   Making scaling, rotation, translation matrices
#   Extracting information (translation, rotation, axes) from a generic matrix
#  Plotting with matrices

# These first few functions are just convenience functions for making specific transformation matrices (translation,
#  rotation, scale). Also a way to refresh your memory with the mechanics of building a specific matrix... Normally,
#  you would never write these (numpy has versions of them - in particular, use scipy's rotation/quaternion class to handle
#  rotations in 3D)
#
# A reminder that all matrices are 3x3 (even though we are in 2d) so that we can do translations (the upper left is the 2x2 matrix)
