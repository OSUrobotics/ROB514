    "# Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices are, fundamentally, about moving rigid objects around in space. This tutorial builds a couple matrices (in 2D), then uses them to plot a circle in different positions. If you are not familiar with matrices look at the slides first.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The major tricky part of this is that the object - the circle - is ALSO represented as a matrix (a **3xn** matrix, **n** being the number of points used to represent the circle).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other tricky parts with matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Order matters. Doing m1 then m2 is NOT the same as m2 then m1. We will use the convention that **pts_new = m1 @ m2 @ m3 pts_orig** means multiply pts_orig by m3, then m2, then m1. Yes, that feels backwards. But that is the convention (left multiply) in most software that uses matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "- You'll notice I used @ and not *.  Numpy decided to use @ instead of * for matrix multiply. * means item by item multiplication which a) will only work if the two matrics are the same size and b) probably isn't what you want).\n",
    "\n",
    "This example puts all of the code that will be re-used into functions in a Python file (**matrix_routines.py**), rather than just writing it in-line. So you should open up that file and look at it, too, then come back and work through this tutorial. \n",

    "- Multiply matrices together\n",
    "- Use matrices to place objects in the world\n",
    "\n",
    "A reminder that all matrices are 3x3 (even though we are in 2d) so that we can do translations (the upper left is the 2x2 matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, look at matrix_routines.py. Look for code that:\n",
    "- Creates matrices\n",
    "- Creates a circle as a list of points\n",
    "- Multiplies points by a matrix and plots the before and after\n",
    "-- Where are the points made/created?\n",
    "-- Where does the multiplicaiton happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an example here that shows swapping the order of the matrices. Try drawing what the rotations/translations would look like on a piece of paper and try to match up the transformations with the code."
