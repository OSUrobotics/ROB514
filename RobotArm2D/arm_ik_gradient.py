# --------------------------- Inverse Kinematics ------------------
# The goal of this part of the assignment is to move the grasp point to a target position.
#
# Option 1: Bare-bones gradient descent
# Option 2: Jacobians all the way down (with pseudo least squares to solve)
#
# Note: The point of this assignment is to get an understanding of how these techniques work. After this, you should
#  never (well, almost never) write your own gradient descent/IK solver

#  grasp position to the target one. I've split this into two functions, one that returns an actual vector, the
#  second of which calls the first then calculates the distance. This is to avoid duplicating code.
