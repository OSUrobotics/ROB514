# This file has two classes, one for the "world" and one for the "sensors"
#    This may be a bit overkill for this assignment, but we'll be using this general structure over
#. and over again, so might as well become familiar with it now.
#  World class keeps track of the "ground truth" of the world
#      - if the door is open or closed
#  it also handles the robot "opening" and "closing the door"
#.     - probabilities of the robot successfully opening/closing the door
#
#. And sensor queries: Ask the sensor if the door is "open"
# 
#  Sensor class handles generating "True/False" queries. The sensor class has access to the World class
#   so it can know the "ground truth" (if the door is ACTUALLY open or closed)
