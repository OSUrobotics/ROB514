"# Instructions\n",
"\n",
"This assignment serves two purposes:\n",
"- An introduction to the autograder/submitting to gradescope\n",
"- An introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and the format of the assignments\n",
"\n",
"For each assignment the top of the Jupyter Notebook will have additional links, either to recommended tutorials and/or slides that further describe the assignment. These slides will have a mix of helpful hints, guidelines, and what the expected outcomes should be (particularly for plots). There is a good chance that any question you have will have an answer in those slides, so check them first. \n",
"\n",
"## Jupyter notebook structure\n",
"\n",
"For each question there's an autograder check; almost always there will be a cell that has the exact same code as the autograder check so you can see what it is. If you pass the autograder checks here, then (probably) you will pass the Gradescope autograder. **You should always check the result of the Gradescope autograder and make sure you got full credit.** If you don't, the reason you didn't is (probably) here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tYa5oycUiG4YhXUq5vHvPOpWJ4k_xUPp2rUNIL7Q9RI/edit?usp=sharing. There are additional instructions at the end of each Jupyter Notebook that you should read before handing in.\n",
"\n",
"There's usually a lot of supplied code/instructions. Anything you're suppose to change is labeled with \"TODO\". When in doubt, look to see what the autograder is checking for.\n"
