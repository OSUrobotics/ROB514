#
#  How do you use numpy's stats package to generalize a single random variable for:
#      a) Booleans (T/F)
#      b) Discrete variables (a, b, c)
#      c) Binned "continuous" variables - 0.1-0.2, 0.2-0.3, etc
#      d) Gaussian distribution
#      e) Non-gaussian distribution (optional)
#
#  Think of these as functions that simulate real-world events - query the sensor for if the door is open (y/n),
#    ask where the robot is (continuous location OR a grid square in the world), ask which room you're in (discrete
#    variable, kitchen dining room, etc). These are all fancy versions of a coin toss (returns T/F with 50% probability each),
#    a roll of the dice (returns 1..6 with equal probability).
#
#  ALL of these "simulate probability" routines can be implemented using JUST numpy's uniform number generator
#    (generates a number between 0 and 1 with all values equally likely). The simplest way to think of all of these
#    methods is that you chop up the unit interval 0..1 into the number of possible outcomes, with each bit of the
#    unit interval representing how likely that event is. Then you just generate a number from 0 to 1 and see which
#    bin you fell into.
#
# For continuous probability functions, you use uniform twice - once to pick the x value, once to pick the y value.
#    If you're doing a Gaussian, of course, just call numpy's random.normal function.
#
# Why the functions are set up they way they are: You need to input how likely each discrete event is. There's three
#    basic methods for specifying this.
#    1) List each discrete event and how likely it is
#    2) All events are equally likely, just say how many there are (bins) and the mapping between the bins and the 'labels'
#         Usually the bins represent some spatial variable like location or angle, but could be movement
#    3) There is a function that represents how likely each event is, with the x coordinate representing some continuous
#         variable like distance (think Gaussian error for movement)
#
# For each method that you'll implement the above information is passed in using a dictionary. I'm using a dictionary
#   (instead of a class) because it's a bit easier to understand/implement, but the 'right' way to do this is as
# a class (see the last, optional, problem).

# ----------------------------- Optional: Probability mass function (discrete) ------------------------------

# This is a more general version of the previous bin variable, with the main difference being that each bin has
#  a different liklihood (as specified by the input function). So it's a combination of the discrete variable (using
#  a running sum to determine which bin you fall in) and the bins (chopping up a continuous variable into bins).
# Technical note: In theory land, there is a difference between doing this as a continuous function (probability density)
# versus chopping it up into pieces (probability mass). You can actually do continuous functions, but it's a bit
# trickier and we don't need it (see for example https://www.comsol.com/blogs/sampling-random-numbers-from-probability-distribution-functions/)
#
# For this example we're going to use a class instead of a method because (in order to make it efficient) you
#   want to pre-calculate a running sum from the given probabilities. It would be very expensive to do this every
#   time you asked for a sample, like you did in the discrete problem.
# This is also a good time to do some fancy numpy array stuff, namely, using "where" to find the index (instead of
#   writing your own for loop)
