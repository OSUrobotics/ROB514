"\n",
"Note that there isn't a \"right\" answer for either of these. This is (mostly) a light-weight way to check your code for obvious problems before trying it in ROS. It's set up to make it easy to download a map and try some robot starting/ending points\n",

"- Image handling\n",
"- plotting\n",
"- Some structure for keeping/changing waypoints and converting to/from the map to the robot's coordinate space\n",
