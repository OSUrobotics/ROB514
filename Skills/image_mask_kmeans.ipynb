"\n",
"# Run kmeans on multiple images\n",
"\n",
"Note: See slides for what order to *implement* these in - this is the order for the code itself. I highly recommend *against* writing it all and then trying to debug it. Do one bit at a time.\n",
"\n",
"- Step 1: If use_hsv is true, convert the image to hsv (see skimage rgb2hsv - skimage has a ton of these conversion routines)\n",
"- Step 2: reshape the data to be an nx3 matrix kmeans assumes each row is a data point. So you have to give it a (widthXheight) X 3 matrix, not the imagedata as-is (WXHX3). See numpy reshape.\n",
"- Step 3: Whiten the data\n",
"- Step 4: Call kmeans with the whitened data to get out the centers\n",
" Note: kmeans returns a tuple with the centers in the first part and the overall fit in the second\n",
"- Step 5: Get the ids out using vq\n",
"    -- This also returns a tuple; the ids for each pixel are in the first part\n",
"    -- You might find the syntax data[ids == i, 0:3] = rgb_color[i] useful - this gets all the data elements with ids with value i and sets them to the color in rgb_color\n",
"- Step 5: Create a mask image, and set the colors by rgb_color[ id for pixel ]\n",
"- Step 6: Create a second mask image, setting the color to be the average color of the cluster\n",
"\n",
"Two ways to do this\n",
" -  \"undo\" the whitening step on the returned cluster (harder)\n",
" -  Calculate the means of the clusters in the original data\n",
"    np.mean(data[ids == c])\n",
"   \n",
"Note: To do the HSV option, get the RGB version to work. Then go back and do the HSV one\n",
"- Simplest way to do this: Copy the code you did before and re-do after converting to hsv first\n",
"     Don't forget to take the color centers in the *original* image, not the hsv one\n",
"     Don't forget to rename your variables\n",
"\n",
"More complicated: Make a function. Most of the code is the same, except for a conversion to hsv at the beginning"
