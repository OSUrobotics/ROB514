    "# Scenario: You have a data set that you *think* clusters into two groups. \n",
    "For each data point you have an associated y value; once you've split the data set into clusters you also want to find the y=f(x) value for each cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "- Version 1: You're given the labels (supervised learning) and you want to see if they're distinguishable\n",
    "- Version 2: You are NOT given the labels, so you use k-means to get an initial labeling, and (optionally) a very simplified version of RANSAC to improve the label assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions:\n",
    "- The x values for each cluster are normally distributed around the cluster's center - i.e., the noise is normally distributed\n",
    "- The y values are related to the x values by a Gaussian, i.e., f is a Gaussian. Note that it could be anything else - a polynomial, etc\n",
    "- There are random outliers in the data set - these points are random both in x and y\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis steps (some of these are done for you):\n",
    "1) Plot the data to determine if you can at least *visually* separate the clusters. We'll do two plots - one that shows the x,y values, the second that shows the distribution of the x-values\n",
    " - if the distribution of the x-values does not have two reasonably clear peaks, you can't separate the two sets of samples\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Version 1: Run a t-test on the known labels to determine if the two x-value distributions are distinguishable\n",
    "2) Version 2: Find the x centers of the clusters using kmeans on the x values\n",
    "3) CHECK that these are two distinct clusters using a t-test\n",
    "4) \"Fit\" a Gaussian to each data set to get an approximation of the parameters for the f function (mu and sigma)\n",
    "5) [Optional] Remove outliers (data points that are not on the Guassian) using a RANSAC algorithm\n",
    "6) CHECK that there's a reasonable Gaussian fit to the two data sets\n",
    "7) [Optional] do a curve fit to further improve the Gaussian reconstruction\n",
    "8) Plot your results over the original data\n",
    "\n",
    "##   To play with: The parameters that you're given at the start should pass both checks. \n",
    "For the last part of the assignment, deliberately \"break\" the t-test/reconstruction in the following ways\n",
    "1) Move the centers together so that the two x distributions are not distinguishable (the histogram does not have two peaks). Does the t-test fail? What does k-means do? How \"good\" are the Gaussian fits? Is each data set a Gaussian? How close can you get before the remove_outlier code is no longer able to 'fix' the result?\n",
    "2) Change just the standard deviations, the number of samples, and the noise level until the t-test breaks. What happens to the kmeans result? Can the remove_outlier code 'fix' the result? How does the added noise play into this?\n",
    "3) Change the ratio of the number of samples for each peak. As the ratio moves farther and farther away from 50/50, what happens to the original t-test? What happens to the kmeans split?\n",
    "4) Re-labeling and re-assignment (optional) - What happens if you re-label? What problems can it fix? Try relabeling once versus twice. Try making the gaussians more similar (moving their centers together, changing sampling ratios, increasing overlap)\n",
    "5) Noise and outlier removal (optional) - What happens if you crank up the noise on the y-values? At what point does the re-labeling/outlier removal break down? What happens if you increase/decrease the aggressivenes of the outlier removal?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other things to play with:\n",
    "1) What happens if you set the number of clusters to 3, 4, or 5? (code will crash if more than 5)\n",
    "2) What happens if you increase the number of random samples? How many can you tolerate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1: I plot the y values with the x values, but you are doing clustering on the x values ONLY, and then fitting the y values - you're not clustering on both together\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 2: I've included all of the libraries/methods you should need (imports)"
