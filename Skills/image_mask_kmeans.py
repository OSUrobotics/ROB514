    # This is how you draw an image in a matplotlib figure
    axs[0].imshow(im_orig)
    # This sets the title
    axs[0].set_title(str_im_name)

    # TODO
    # Step 1: If use_hsv is true, convert the image to hsv (see skimage rgb2hsv - skimage has a ton of these
    #  conversion routines)
    # Step 2: reshape the data to be an nx3 matrix
    #   kmeans assumes each row is a data point. So you have to give it a (widthXheight) X 3 matrix, not the image
    #   data as-is (WXHX3). See numpy reshape.
    # Step 3: Whiten the data
    # Step 4: Call kmeans with the whitened data to get out the centers
    #   Note: kmeans returns a tuple with the centers in the first part and the overall fit in the second
    # Step 5: Get the ids out using vq
    #   This also returns a tuple; the ids for each pixel are in the first part
    #   You might find the syntax data[ids == i, 0:3] = rgb_color[i] useful - this gets all the data elements
    #     with ids with value i and sets them to the color in rgb_color
    # Step 5: Create a mask image, and set the colors by rgb_color[ id for pixel ]
    # Step 6: Create a second mask image, setting the color to be the average color of the cluster
    #    Two ways to do this
    #       1) "undo" the whitening step on the returned cluster (harder)
    #       2) Calculate the means of the clusters in the original data
    #           np.mean(data[ids == c])
    #
    # Note: To do the HSV option, get the RGB version to work. Then go back and do the HSV one
    #   Simplest way to do this: Copy the code you did before and re-do after converting to hsv first
    #     Don't forget to take the color centers in the *original* image, not the hsv one
    #     Don't forget to rename your variables
    #   More complicated: Make a function. Most of the code is the same, except for a conversion to hsv at the beginning
