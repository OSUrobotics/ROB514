# This class keeps track of the "ground truth" of the robot's location
#  - where the robot actually is
#  - moves the robot in the direction asked, with some noise
#
# There are two types of movement; either discrete movement (i.e., from one bin to the next) or continuous movement
#   (move by some amount). The discrete motion is used for the bayes filter, the other two for the particle/kalman
#   filter movement.
#
# Homework instructions:
#   You'll be filling in the code to "add noise" to the robot's movement. There's two parts to this; the first is to
#     set up the dictionaries that hold the probabilities, the second is to sample from those probability distributions.
#   There are THREE probability distributions you need to set up:
#     move_left - what happens in the discrete/bin world when you move left one bin
#     move_right - same thing as move_left, but now you're moving right one bin
#     move_continuous - move by some distance (negative is left, positive is right)
#
#  move_left/move_right are versions of the discrete probability dictionaries you set up in probability assignment
#   (probability_sampling). This is used for the Bayes filter part of the assignment
#  move_continuous is a version of the gaussian sampling. This is used for the Kalman filter/particle filter part of
#   the assignment
#
