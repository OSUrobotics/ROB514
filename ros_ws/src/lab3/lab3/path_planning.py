# This assignment implements Dijkstra's shortest path on a graph, finding an unvisited node in a graph,
#   picking which one to visit, and taking a path in the map and generating waypoints along that path

# Given to you:
#   Priority queue
#   Image handling
#   Four and Eight connected neighbors
